This outlines how to implement the brainfuck operators in Half-Broken Car in Heavy Traffic.

Each operator takes its input on the left, and outputs on the right. As such, you should be
able to transpile a brainfuck program (which doesn't use as I/O) to HBCHT by first orienting the car
(with orient.hb), then chaining together the implementation of the operators listed below, corresponding
to the original program.

Note; > and < take two steps instead of one. This effectively means that we only use every other cell on
the tape - and, more importantly - every other cell on the tape is always a zero; which means that / always
compares the current cell to zero; matching the semantics of [ ... ] in brainfuck.
